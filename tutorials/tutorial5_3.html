<!-- Develop a script that will determine the gross pay for each of three employees. The
company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays
“time and a half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You’re given a list of the
employees of the company, the number of hours each employee worked last week and the
hourly rate of each employee. Your script should input this information for each employee,
determine the employee’s gross pay and output HTML5 text that displays the employee’s
gross pay. Use prompt dialogs to input the data. -->
